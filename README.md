### Introduction

The Mars Exploration and Colonization project simulates the exploration and colonization of Mars using a set of classes and components. It consists of the following main components:

- **Exploration Simulator:** Simulates the exploration phase on Mars, where rovers are deployed to explore the Martian surface.

- **Colonization Simulator:** Simulates the colonization phase on Mars, where the resources gathered during exploration are utilized to establish colonies.

- **Rovers:** Represents the robotic vehicles used for exploration and colonization. Rovers have routines, phases, and analyzers that define their behavior.

- **Command Center:** Represents the central control center for the rovers. It manages resources and coordinates the activities of the rovers.

- **Finder:** Provides utility methods for finding neighboring coordinates on the Mars map.

### Features

The Mars Exploration and Colonization project offers the following features:

- Simulation of the exploration phase, where rovers explore the Martian surface.

- Simulation of the colonization phase, where resources gathered during exploration are used to establish colonies.

- Rovers with customizable routines, phases, and analyzers.

- Command center management of resources and coordination of rover activities.

- Utility methods for finding neighboring coordinates on the Mars map.

### Getting Started

To get started with the Mars Exploration and Colonization project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/AlinDedu/mars-exploration-java-AlinDedu.git

2. Open the project in your preferred Java development environment.

3. Build the project and resolve any dependencies.

4. Explore the codebase and familiarize yourself with the classes and components.

5. Customize the routines, phases, and analyzers of the rovers according to your requirements.

### Usage

The Mars Exploration and Colonization project provides two main entry points:

1. **ExplorationSimulator:** Simulates the exploration phase on Mars.

   - Execute the simulate method to start the exploration simulation.
   - Customize the simulation parameters and rules according to your needs.

2. **ColonizationSimulator:** Simulates the colonization phase on Mars.

   - Execute the simulate method, providing the context from the exploration phase as input.
   - Customize the simulation parameters and rules according to your needs.
